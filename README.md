# Group_Project
This project is oriented towards the group project for UT's Data Boot Camp.

**Roles**
 - **Eduardo** Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository. 
 - **Caroline** Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.
 - **Raquel** Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure that the database works seamlessly with the rest of the project.
 - X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies to use for each step of the project. If the team has only three members, then all three members should be contributing to these decisions.
