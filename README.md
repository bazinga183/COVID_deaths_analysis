# Group_Project
This project is oriented towards the group project for UT's Data Boot Camp.

# Communication Protocols
Our main line of communication will come from using Slack to coordinate which parts of the project we are working on and will begin working on as well as weekly Team Meetings via Zoom. All updates regarding the project are posted within Slack and will be communicated to Eduardo as he will be the one who manages the GitHub repository for this project.

In addition, any pull requests to any branch(es) will be communicated to each team member during a team meeting and we will all go through the data together and see if we approve of the outcome.  

# Week 1
- **Selected Topic:** We've decided to focus on outcomes of COVID-19 cases in the US. The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing health crisis, and quantifying the relationship between patient health and death from COVID can be instrumental in discovering issues that may be contributing to the disease's death toll. It can also be valuable in reducing the impact of future pandemics.
- **Source Data:** Our primary source will be [COVID-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf) from the CDC. The data set records both probable and confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US, as well as details about the patient, including sex, age group, race, ethnicity, presence of underlying health conditions, whether the patient received hospital or ICU care, and whether case resulted in death. With this data, we hope to discover which factors contribute most strongly to COVID-19 case outcome.

**Roles**
 - **Eduardo** Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository. 
 - **Caroline** Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.
 - **Raquel** Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure that the database works seamlessly with the rest of the project.
 - X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies to use for each step of the project. If the team has only three members, then all three members should be contributing to these decisions.
